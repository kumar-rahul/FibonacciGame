to slide the tiles around the board. Combine numbers that are next to each other in the Fibonacci sequence to make bigger numbers. See if you can get to 2584!The Fibonacci numbers are a list (called a "sequence") of numbers that is built a very special way. It starts with 1,1... and then you add 1 + 1 to get to the next number.

That gives 1,1,2... Then you add 1+2 to get the next number...
That gives 1,1,2,3... Then you add 2+3 to get the next number...
That gives 1,1,2,3,5 ... Then you add 3+5 to get the next number...
That gives 1,1,2,3,5,8... Then you add 5+8 and you keep going!

1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89...
